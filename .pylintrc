[DESIGN]
# McCabe complexity cyclomatic threshold for too-complex check
#  Value definied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity
#   - The figure of 10 had received substantial corroborating evidence,
#     but that in some circumstances it may be appropriate to relax the restriction
#     and permit modules with a complexity as high as 15
